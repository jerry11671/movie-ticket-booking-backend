# movie-ticket-booking-backend

A backend application designed to help users book movie tickets. Admins can manage movies and showtimes, while viewers can browse available showtimes, select seats, and book tickets securely. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication, this project provides a robust and scalable solution for movie ticket reservations.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with JWT-based authentication.
- **Movie Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete movies with poster and trailer uploads via Cloudinary.
- **Showtime Management**: Admins can schedule showtimes for movies with seat availability tracking.
- **Booking System**: Users can:
  - View available seats for a showtime.
  - Book tickets by selecting seats.
  - View their booking history.
  - Cancel bookings, freeing up seats.
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate privileges for "admin" and "viewer" roles.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error responses for a smooth user experience.
- **CORS Support**: Enables frontend integration from different origins.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt for password hashing
- **File Uploads**: Cloudinary for movie posters and trailers
- **Middleware**: Custom authentication, admin authorization, error handling
- **Validation**: Joi for input validation
- **Environment**: dotenv for configuration
- **Others**: `express-async-errors`, `http-status-codes`, `cors`
